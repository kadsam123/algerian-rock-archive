Subject: Technical Update: Migration to SQLite & Cloud Deployment
To: R&D Team
From: Issam (Lead Architect)

1. Mission Status
The "Algerian Rock Archive" has been successfully refactored from a text-based prototype (JSON) to a database-backed application (SQLite). The application is deployed to production via Streamlit Community Cloud.

2. Key Engineering Decisions
* Database Layer: Adopted sqlite3 to ensure ACID compliance (data integrity) and scalable querying capabilities.
* Schema Design: Implemented a normalized table structure (artists) with text fields for bio/metadata and string-parsing for list data (tracks).
* Cloud Persistence: Acknowledged the "Ephemeral Cloud" constraint. While the code is persistent, user-uploaded SQLite data on the Community Tier resets on reboot. Strategy: This is acceptable for V1; V2 will require an external database (Supabase/AWS).

3. Next Objectives
* Initiate Project "Global Village" (Code Reuse Strategy).
* Clone the current architecture to create a "Digital Vitrine" for physical products.
